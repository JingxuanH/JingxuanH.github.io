- I received a BS in Life Science from Wuhan University, China in 2017. Now I am a first-year MS student in Biostatistics at Columbia University Medical Center.

- Previously I have worked on three projects. In the last year of my undergrad, I was a student intern at UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas and I worked on a project to build predictive model using longitudinal data for renal cell carcinoma patients. Also I had two biological-based projects. The one was done in my second year of undergrad is about hyperlipidemia. And the other one is about axon regeneration in C. elegans and I did it in my junior year of undergrad at UC San Diego.  The full description of my projects can be viewd on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jingxuanh/).
